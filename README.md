# MemeClassifier
This project is an Image Classification Model retrained from Google's Inception v3 Model through Transfer Learning to identify some dank memes. Much of the work from this project comes from a TensorFlow tutorial on transfer learning. Fatkun Bulk Download was used to bulk download images from google images searches of these memes. The model was trained on a TensorFlow Docker container using the sets of images from the internet over 1000 training steps.

## Usage:
python label_image.py [image_path]

## List of supported memes:
* dat boi
* doge
* harambe
* pepe
* socially awkward penguin
* troll face
